Inspired by lots of media attention (putting it mildly), let's examine some public data on COVID-19 (aka "Coronavirus") poistive tests and fatalities.

This work was inspired by Isaac Faber, who posted some code on his <a href="https://github.com/isaacfab/tinker/tree/master/covid19">github repo</a>.

At time of publishing, the White House has issued a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-machine-learning-cord-19-chan-zuckerberg-ostp/">call to action</a>" from AI researchers.  Public data has been made avaiable <a href="https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research">here</a>.

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("GuangchuangYu/nCov2019")
# select "none"

library(nCov2019)
library(tidyverse)

# Get the latest data
x <- get_nCov2019(lang = 'en')
head(x)
```

We've scratched the surface of the data avaiable, but it's enough to get started.  A lot of published visualizations and statistics focus on China, but we'll focus on the globe and finally the USA.

Let's look at countries where there have been coronavirus-related deaths and see exactly how fatal the virus is.

```
# just the global level data
covid_data_global <- x$global %>% 
  filter(deadRate > 0) %>% 
  mutate(deadRate = as.numeric(deadRate)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(deadRate)) 
covid_data_global

lolli <- ggplot(covid_data_global, aes(x=deadRate, y=reorder(name,deadRate))) +
  # ggplot themes:  https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(size=2, aes(colour='red')) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0, xend=deadRate, y=name, yend=name)) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Death Rate (Percent)") +
  ggtitle("Death Rate by Country",subtitle = "Percent who die with positive test") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
lolli
```

Things look quite treacherous in Sudan, Guatemala, Ukriane and Guyana.  But why, then, do we keep hearing about China and Italy in the news?

```
# show cumulative deaths
glbl_deaths <- x$global %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dead)) %>%
  filter(dead > 4) %>% 
  mutate(dead = as.numeric(dead)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(dead)) 
glbl_deaths

lolli2 <- ggplot(glbl_deaths, aes(x=dead, y=reorder(name,dead))) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(size=2, aes(colour='red')) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0, xend=dead, y=name, yend=name)) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("# Deaths") +
  ggtitle("Deaths by Country",subtitle = "Countries with 5 deaths or more") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
lolli2
```

While Sudan had the worst mortality rating, it doesn't even make this plot.  Thus, it's had all positive tests result in a fatality, but less than 5 fatalities in total.

We see what is reflected in the news quite clearly:  China has had the most deaths due to the virus.  Next up are Italy and Iran.

```
# load historical data which is more useful for global time series
covid_data_ts <- load_nCov2019(lang = 'en', source='github')
head(covid_data_ts)

covid_data_ts_glbl <- covid_data_ts$global
head(covid_data_ts_glbl)
```

If you want to see a sorted list of countries (most deaths to least), the below would also get that done.

```
############ same as lollipop analysis above ############
# find the current death count by country
# covid_global_ttl <- covid_data_ts_glbl %>% 
#   group_by(country) %>% 
#   summarise(current_dead = max(cum_dead)) %>% 
#   arrange(desc(current_dead)) %>% 
#   filter(current_dead > 0)

# current death count by country
# covid_global_ttl
############ same as lollipop analysis above ############
```

Next, let's look at the global impact felt by COVID-19.  How many people have died from this disease so far?

```
# sort by date and show cumulative deaths
covid_global_daily <- covid_data_ts_glbl %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarise(current_dead = max(cum_dead)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(time))
head(covid_global_daily)

# show total death rate globally
ttl_plt <- ggplot(covid_global_daily, aes(x=time, y=current_dead)) +
  ylab("Cumulative Deaths") +
  xlab("Dec '19 to Present") +
  ggtitle("Worldwide Deaths from COVID-19") +
  geom_line(stat="identity") + 
  # change theme to include grid for visible reference lines
  theme_minimal()
ttl_plt
```

While this feels like a relatively new topic in the US, we see that COVID-19 fatalities actually started in December of last year.  Deaths showed tremendous increases in February and have since flattened out a bit.   Perhaps this is why "2019" follows the coronavirus term in most news?

Let's expand on this by adding in colors to show the information by Country.  We'll only look at the top 8 countries (most human fatalities to-date) since it's generally hard to distinguish between categorical variables using color after that numerical threshold has been crossed.

```
# narrow down country list until 8 or less categorical variables
# this ensures each is distinguishable
covid_data_filtered <- covid_data_ts_glbl %>% filter(cum_dead > 29)

# manually select colors that are distinct from one another
# https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/
fill_manual <- c("#77b592",
                 "#7e46b8",
                 "#91cf53",
                 "#c2568d",
                 "#be9c56",
                 "#8e98c4",
                 "#c4513a",
                 "#4c3b3c")

top_count <- ggplot(covid_data_filtered, aes(x=time, y=cum_dead, fill=country)) +
  geom_area() + 
  ggtitle('Confirmed Global Deaths From COVID 19', subtitle = 'running total by countries with 30+ deaths as of March 17, 2020') +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  # change theme to include grid for visible reference lines
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=fill_manual) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
top_count
```

We again see that China is the leader of the pack.  Italy is big, but it lags China's start by over a month.  The USA does make the top 8, though it's the most recent country to show up on this plot.  Thus, one might conclude that fatalities have just begun for us.

Next, let's play around a little bit with a data visualization, ignoring best practices, to show total deaths to-date in a cumulative order and by country.  Code inspired by <a href="https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019/blob/master/example.R">GuangchuangYu</a>.

```
# create spiral with all countries with deaths
# leveraging code, with edits, from https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019/blob/master/example.R

install.packages("shadowtext")
install.packages("ggplotify")
require(shadowtext)
require(ggplotify)

glbl_dtaset <- covid_data_ts['global']

dd <- filter(glbl_dtaset, time == time(covid_data_ts)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cum_confirm)) 

# prep data
dd = dd[1:40, ]
dd$country = factor(dd$country, levels=dd$country)
cols <- rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(10, "RdYlGn"))
dd$angle = 1:40 * 360/40
label_cut = 150
i = dd$angle >= 180 & dd$cum_confirm > label_cut
dd$angle[i] = dd$angle[i] + 180
j = dd$angle < 180 & dd$cum_confirm < 1000
dd$angle[j] = dd$angle[j] - 90
dd$vjust = 1
dd$vjust[i] = 0
dd$vjust[j] = 0.5
dd$covid_data_ts = dd$cum_confirm *.8
dd$covid_data_ts[j] = dd$covid_data_ts[j] * .7
```

Now that the data has been prepared, we can plot it.

```
# plot data
spiral <- ggplot(dd, aes(country, cum_confirm, fill=cum_confirm)) + 
  geom_col(width=1, color='grey90') + 
  geom_col(aes(y=I(5)), width=1, fill='grey90', alpha = .2) +       
  geom_col(aes(y=I(3)), width=1, fill='grey90', alpha = .2) +    
  geom_col(aes(y=I(2)), width=1, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_log10() + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=cols, trans="log") + 
  geom_shadowtext(aes(label=paste(country, cum_confirm, sep="\n"), 
                      y = covid_data_ts, angle=angle, 
                      vjust=vjust), 
                  data=function(glbl_dtaset) glbl_dtaset[glbl_dtaset$cum_confirm > label_cut,], 
                  size=3, colour = "white", bg.colour="black", 
                  fontface="bold")  + 
  geom_text(aes(label=paste0(cum_confirm, ", ", country), 
                y = max(cum_confirm) * 2,  
                angle=angle+90), 
            data=function(glbl_dtaset) glbl_dtaset[glbl_dtaset$cum_confirm < label_cut,], 
            size=3, vjust=1) + 
  coord_polar(direction=-1) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(legend.position="none") 

ggplotify::as.ggplot(spiral, scale=1.2, vjust=-.1)
```

Again, we see that China has felt the impacts moreso than other countries.  If the USA is of interest to you, consider this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">NYT article</a>.

John's Hopkins is producing possibly <a https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">the best data out there</a>.

Note: Since I'm in Orlando, let's focus on Florida.  <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19/">here</a> is what the state is publishing.  At time of publish, 173 confirmed and 6 deaths.
