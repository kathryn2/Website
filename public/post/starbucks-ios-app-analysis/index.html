<p>Have you ever wanted to see more detail behind apps on your iOS device? There’s an R package called ‘itunesr’ that allows for free extracts of user ratings and reviews. Combining that with some sentiment analysis, you can examine any trends for apps of interest.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to identify an app of interest. I use the <br>Starbucks</br> app quite a bit and have read numerous articles about it’s success. So, let’s see if ‘itunesr’ tells a smiliar story.</p>
<p>Let’s install the needed programs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set CRAN Mirror
options(repos = c(CRAN = &quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&quot;))

# Set time zone
options(tz=&quot;America/New_York&quot;)

# install itunesr directly from CRAN:
install.packages(&quot;itunesr&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Installing package into &#39;/Users/kathryn_daugherty/Library/R/3.5/library&#39;
## (as &#39;lib&#39; is unspecified)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## The downloaded binary packages are in
##  /var/folders/gb/t5w_mwv15mv1rqgt0c4n0m500000gn/T//Rtmp0ZVLk9/downloaded_packages</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
# devtools::install_github(&quot;amrrs/itunesr&quot;)
library(itunesr)</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s find the app’s ID. To do this, you must search for it in the apple online store and you’ll find the number in the URL. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starbucks/id331177714">Here</a> is Starbucks’ page and you’ll note that its ID is 331177714.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Starbucks page:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starbucks/id331177714
# Latest (Page 1) Starbucks Reviews for the Country: US
sbux_reviews &lt;- getReviews(331177714,&#39;us&#39;,1)
head(sbux_reviews,2)</code></pre>

## 1 The new Starbucks store in Kearny NJ us ridiculously slow. When I use the app, it has taken up to 50 minutes to get my order.  One time, I waited and asked them to verify that they had received my order. They said they had, then 10 minutes later, said they had run out of the product. It’s a new store and perhaps they are working thru some kinks but they need to resolve this soon.
## 2                                                                        Love this app! It was beautifully designed (great UI/UX) and functions virtually flawlessly. Not a huge deal, but my only suggestion would be to be able to load an exiting gift card with another gift card’s balance, rather than having to create a new card, transfer the balance, then delete the card. Thank you.

<p>We see that the rating is generally pretty high. But, this doesn’t take advantage of all the text users have provided. To measure that, let’s use Bing’s defined sentiments to illustrate how postivie/negative the feedback is.</p>

Thank you.&quot;

## [5] &quot;Unlike other food and beverage apps (like Chick-fil-a) this app requires you to load funds - that you will not use entirely - to a Starbucks card in order to get rewards. It’s my money and I would like to pay from whatever card I choose. I would also like to add lower increments ($2,$3, $5 etc) rather than a minimum of $10. It’s inevitable to end up with a few dollars sitting on your card for Starbucks to utilize until your next visit which will likely cost most than the few bucks you have left, requiring yet another load. Starbucks absolutely has their own best interest at heart here.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
## [6] &quot;I use this app every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. It’s so convenient to be able to order exactly what we need instead of having to send my fumbling fiancé to the drive through to jumble the order and come back with all the wrong things. We have dairy allergies in the house, so one fumbled order equals someone going without their drink or breakfast. No bueno. Not to mention, being able to place your order, then either going through the drive through or running inside and wiggling through the crowd to grab your things and go - it’s likely one of the best ideas Starbucks has ever had. (Although I’m sure - and we’ve witnessed - the employees are cursing it some days when the mobile orders are coming in one after the other and the lines are out the door and/or around the corner!)\n\nI do have a couple of suggestions if Starbucks is open to hearing them. :)\n\n1. It’d be really nice if there was an option to select within each drink order for the strawless lids. (And/or things like the cardboard sleeves and drink stoppers.)\n\n2. Because we are a dairy sensitive family, a lot of the time I’ll order myself and my children fraps with almond milk (which is wonderful, thank you so much for the dairy free options!!). However, we *can* have a *small* amount of dairy, so the whipped cream is a treat, and totally okay as long as we order the drink itself nondairy. But - when we order via the app, the employees assume the whipped cream needs to be avoided as well, even though I do not specify it. So to avoid this what I’ve learned to do is to check “extra whipped cream” along with “almond milk” just so they know not to skip the whip. So my point is, it would be really nice if there was something to say yes, we want our frap with almond milk, but please don’t skip the delicious whip. :)\n\n3. I have celiac disease also, so I can’t have 96% of the amazing food Starbucks offers. I *love* the egg bites (and have gotten many friends hooked as well!) and your gluten free rice crispy bars.. but it sure would be nice if there were even just one more gluten free option on the menu. :) It would be so very deeply appreciated!\n\nThank you! Starbucks fan for life!&quot;</code></pre>
