      <description>Have you ever wanted to see more detail behind apps on your iOS device? There’s an R package called ‘itunesr’ that allows for free extracts of user ratings and reviews. Combining that with some sentiment analysis, you can examine any trends for apps of interest.
First, you’ll need to identify an app of interest. I use the Starbucks app quite a bit and have read numerous articles about it’s success.</description>

      <description>My sister is a Pharmacist. My wife is an Environmental Scientist / Project Manager. They’re both interested in Public Health, though they work in very different environments. Then there’s me: which box do you check for Revenue Management Analyst or Data Scientist?
To try and define my role, I compared three defined options: Financial Analysts, Business Intelligence Analysts and Industrial Engineers. I felt these might be most representative of what I do.</description>

      <description>A Kaggle data source here provides the public with information on Texas death row inmates from 1982 to 2017. It includes name, age, race, county, date, and last words from each person. We will analyze this using R to conduct text analysis.
Let’s load up tidytext to get started and then pull in the text data file.
# Set up tidytext require(tidytext) # Set working directory setwd(&amp;quot;~/Desktop/R/TX_Executions/text/&amp;quot;) # Load dataset offenders &amp;lt;- read.</description>

      <description>We will answer this question using R. First, load the dataset. It contains state names, census regions, census divisions, 2013 populations and the number of registered gun owners (also in 2013). This data comes to us from CBS News.
# Set working directory setwd(&amp;quot;~/Desktop&amp;quot;) # Load dataset library(readxl) Firearms_Data_KAD &amp;lt;- read_excel(&amp;quot;~/Desktop/R/Per Capita Firearms Registered/Firearms_Data_KAD.xlsx&amp;quot;) head(Firearms_Data_KAD) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## StateName StateLower CensusRegion Division `2013Pop` `2013Registered… ## &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; ## 1 Wyoming wyoming West Mountain 582658 114052 ## 2 District … district o… South South At… 646449 42897 ## 3 Arkansas arkansas South West Sou… 2959373 123130 ## 4 New Mexico new mexico West Mountain 2085287 84471 ## 5 Virginia virginia South South At… 8260405 248939 ## 6 Idaho idaho West Mountain 1612136 39019 Next, let’s load all of the packages we’ll use for data transformations and visualizations.</description>

      <description>This analysis uses 3 datasets. The first has information from the NFL draft, the second has information on NFL team statistics, and the third includes information from the Deflategate scandal involving the New England Patriots.
Let’s load the needed data and R packages.
# Install needed packages library(ggplot2) library(vcd) library(stats) library(car) # Load data that will be used for this analysis # Rename Football Stats dataset (with drank rankings) footballstats.</description>

      <description>For a project in my data visualization class, I created an infographic summarizing some information on the Grapefruit League. Every spring, American baseball teams move to Florida (Grapefruit League) or Arizona (Cactus League) to train. There are multiple teams in the Orlando area every year, which is what inspired me to examine this particular topic.
A PDF of the report and final infographic can be found here. The following will walk through how the base R images were created.</description>
