<p>Inspired by lots of media attention (putting it mildly), let’s examine some public data on COVID-19 (aka “Coronavirus”) poistive tests and fatalities.</p>
<p>This work was inspired by Isaac Faber, who posted some code on his <a href="https://github.com/isaacfab/tinker/tree/master/covid19">github repo</a>.</p>
<p>At time of publishing, the White House has issued a &quot;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-machine-learning-cord-19-chan-zuckerberg-ostp/">call to action</a>&quot; from AI researchers. Public data has been made avaiable <a href="https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code># install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)
remotes::install_github(&quot;GuangchuangYu/nCov2019&quot;)

library(tidyverse)

# Get the latest data
x &lt;- get_nCov2019(lang = &#39;en&#39;)
head(x)</code></pre>
<p>We’ve scratched the surface of the data avaiable, but it’s enough to get started. A lot of published visualizations and statistics focus on China, but we’ll focus on the globe and finally the USA.</p>
<p>Let’s look at countries where there have been coronavirus-related deaths and see exactly how fatal the virus is.</p>
<pre><code># just the global level data
covid_data_global &lt;- x$global %&gt;% 
  filter(deadRate &gt; 0) %&gt;% 
  mutate(deadRate = as.numeric(deadRate)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(deadRate))

  ylab(&quot;&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;Death Rate (Percent)&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Death Rate by Country&quot;,subtitle = &quot;Percent who die with positive test&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)
lolli</code></pre>

<p>Things look quite treacherous in Sudan, Guatemala, Ukriane and Guyana. But why, then, do we keep hearing about China and Italy in the news?</p>
<pre><code># show cumulative deaths
glbl_deaths &lt;- x$global %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(dead)) %&gt;%
  filter(dead &gt; 4) %&gt;% 
  mutate(dead = as.numeric(dead)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(dead)) 
glbl_deaths

lolli2 &lt;- ggplot(glbl_deaths, aes(x=dead, y=reorder(name,dead))) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(size=2, aes(colour=&#39;red&#39;)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0, xend=dead, y=name, yend=name)) +
  ylab(&quot;&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;# Deaths&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Deaths by Country&quot;,subtitle = &quot;Countries with 5 deaths or more&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)
lolli2</code></pre>
<p><IMG SRC="/post/2020-03-17-coronavirus_files/Rplot02.png"></p>
<p>While Sudan had the worst mortality rating, it doesn’t even make this plot. Thus, it’s had all positive tests result in a fatality, but less than 5 fatalities in total.</p>
<p>We see what is reflected in the news quite clearly: China has had the most deaths due to the virus. Next up are Italy and Iran.</p>
<pre><code># load historical data which is more useful for global time series
covid_data_ts &lt;- load_nCov2019(lang = &#39;en&#39;, source=&#39;github&#39;)
head(covid_data_ts)

covid_data_ts_glbl &lt;- covid_data_ts$global
head(covid_data_ts_glbl)</code></pre>
<p>If you want to see a sorted list of countries (most deaths to least), the below would also get that done.</p>
<pre><code>############ same as lollipop analysis above ############
# find the current death count by country
# covid_global_ttl &lt;- covid_data_ts_glbl %&gt;% 
#   group_by(country) %&gt;% 
#   summarise(current_dead = max(cum_dead)) %&gt;% 
#   arrange(desc(current_dead)) %&gt;% 
#   filter(current_dead &gt; 0)

# current death count by country
# covid_global_ttl
############ same as lollipop analysis above ############</code></pre>
<p>Next, let’s look at the global impact felt by COVID-19. How many people have died from this disease so far?</p>
<pre><code># sort by date and show cumulative deaths
covid_global_daily &lt;- covid_data_ts_glbl %&gt;% 
  group_by(time) %&gt;% 
  summarise(current_dead = max(cum_dead)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(time))
head(covid_global_daily)

# show total death rate globally
ttl_plt &lt;- ggplot(covid_global_daily, aes(x=time, y=current_dead)) +
  ylab(&quot;Cumulative Deaths&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;Dec &#39;19 to Present&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Worldwide Deaths from COVID-19&quot;) +
  geom_line(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + 
  # change theme to include grid for visible reference lines
  theme_minimal()
ttl_plt</code></pre>

<p>While this feels like a relatively new topic in the US, we see that COVID-19 fatalities actually started in December of last year. Deaths showed tremendous increases in February and have since flattened out a bit. Perhaps this is why “2019” follows the coronavirus term in most news?</p>
<p>Let’s expand on this by adding in colors to show the information by Country. We’ll only look at the top 8 countries (most human fatalities to-date) since it’s generally hard to distinguish between categorical variables using color after that numerical threshold has been crossed.</p>
<pre><code># narrow down country list until 8 or less categorical variables
# this ensures each is distinguishable
covid_data_filtered &lt;- covid_data_ts_glbl %&gt;% filter(cum_dead &gt; 29)

# manually select colors that are distinct from one another

<p>We again see that China is the leader of the pack. Italy is big, but it lags China’s start by over a month. The USA does make the top 8, though it’s the most recent country to show up on this plot. Thus, one might conclude that fatalities have just begun for us.</p>
<p>Next, let’s play around a little bit with a data visualization, ignoring best practices, to show total confirmed cases (positive tests) to-date in a cumulative order and by country. Code inspired by <a href="https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019/blob/master/example.R">GuangchuangYu</a>.</p>

<p>Again, we see that China has felt the impacts moreso than other countries. If the USA is of interest to you, consider this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">NYT article</a>.</p>
<p>John’s Hopkins is producing possibly <a href=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">the best data out there</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Since I'm in Orlando, let's focus on Florida, find state-specific data <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19/">here</a>. At time of publish, 173 confirmed and 6 deaths.
