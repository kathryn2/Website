Let's explore the package 'collapsableTree' using NFL data.  I foraged the internet to create a fairly simple csv file with columns Sport, Division, Region, Team, and Cap_Spend.  The values in Cap_Spend are the team's active (2020) active salary spends per <a href="http://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/">OverTheCap.com</a>.

Let's get R set-up and then we can explore.

```
# Set CRAN Mirror
options(repos = c(CRAN = "http://cran.rstudio.com"))

# Set time zone
options(tz="America/New_York")
```

We're going to use the collapsableTree library to create the visualization.  Documentation is available <a href="https://adeelk93.github.io/collapsibleTree/">here</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/collapsibleTree/collapsibleTree.pdf">here</a>.

```
# Load data set 
library(readxl)
Football_Caps <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Football_Caps.xls")
head(Football_Caps)
```

```
# Load needed libraries
library(collapsibleTree)
```

The basic tree is fairly straight-forward to create.

```
# Click on nodes to expand
collapsibleTree(Football_Caps,
            hierarchy = c("Division","Region","Team"),
            width = 500)
```

(If the above image does not show on your screen, click <a href="http://rpubs.com/Kathryn_Ann_22/533407">HERE</a> instead.)

Let's also show the salary cap information that we added.  We'll need the dplyr package to do this.  To get the cumulative spending for each branch of the hierarchy, we'll use a sum function.  Make sure you hover over each node and notice that the exact salary spending is listed.

```
library(dplyr)

Football_Caps %>%
  group_by(Division, Region, Team) %>%
  summarize(`Salary Spending` = sum(Cap_Spend)) %>%
collapsibleTreeSummary(
  hierarchy = c("Division","Region","Team"),
  root = "Football_Caps",
  width = 500,
  attribute = "Salary Spending")
```

What if we just wanted variation in the colors.  I like blue, so we'll have each node be a shade of blue.

```
divisionColors <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(length(unique(Football_Caps$Division)), "Blues")
# Regions will be a gradient that resets between divisions
regionColors <- Football_Caps %>%
  arrange(Division, Region) %>% 
  group_by(Division) %>%
  distinct(Region) %>%
  mutate(colors = colorspace::sequential_hcl(length(Region))[seq_along(Region)])
# Teams will also be a gradient that resets between divisions, but not Regions
teamColors <- Football_Caps %>%
  arrange(Division, Region) %>% 
  group_by(Division) %>%
  distinct(Team) %>%
  mutate(colors = colorspace::sequential_hcl(length(Team))[seq_along(Team)])

Football_Caps %>%
  arrange(Division, Region, Team) %>%
  collapsibleTree(
    hierarchy = c("Division", "Region", "Team"),
    root = "Football_Caps",
    width = 500,
    fill = c(divisionColors, regionColors$colors, teamColors$colors))
```

Let's also examine the salary cap data.  To first get a view of the spread, we'll use a violin plot via the plotly package.  Information on plotly is available <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">here</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/r/violin/">here</a>.


```
library(plotly)

Football_Caps %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~Cap_Spend, type = 'violin',
    box = list(visible = T),
    meanline = list(visible = T),
    x0 = 'Salary Spending') %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "", zeroline = F))
```
<IMG SRC="/post/2019-09-28-nfl-tree-and-cap-spending_files/plot1.png">

We see great dispersion in salary spending, ranging from $101M to 214M.  The median is 154M USD.  Let's break this up between the AFC and NFC.

```
Football_Caps %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~Division, y = ~Cap_Spend, split = ~Division,
    type = 'violin',
    box = list(visible = T),
    meanline = list(visible = T)) %>% 
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Division"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Salary Spending",zeroline = F))
```
<IMG SRC="/post/2019-09-28-nfl-tree-and-cap-spending_files/Rplot2.png">

The NFC tends to spend more on players than the AFC.  Let's look at individual teams.

```
plot_ly(Football_Caps, x = ~Team, y = ~Cap_Spend, type = 'bar') 
  %>% layout(title = "2020 Salary Spend in the NFL")
```
<IMG SRC="/post/2019-09-28-nfl-tree-and-cap-spending_files/plot3.png">

We see that the Jaguars spend the most while the Dolphins spend the least.

[THE END]
